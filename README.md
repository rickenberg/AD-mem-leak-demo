Memory Leak Demo
================

This program reads one Active Directory group and gets all users from it. It is used to demonstrate how to use the Visual Studio tools to find managed and native memory leaks in your code.

I assume that you have never debugged native code before and have only barely noticed the memory profiler tool, that was introduced in Visual Studio 2015.

All descriptions and screen-shots are for Visual Studio 2017.
